# KAX Unofficial :: Changes

* 2015-0107: 2.3.4 (Keptin) for KSP 0.90
	+ Maintaining mods between major KSP updates takes work; lots of little things break and need fixing. I'm happy to announce that KAX now has fewer bugs than ever, making KSP 0.90 the best supported version to date! Yay!
	+ Updated Firespitter.dll with RadarManFromTheMoon's rotor thrust switching fix
	+ Kuey Tail Rotor now properly switches thrust with user input
	+ Fixed KAX Agents .cfg
