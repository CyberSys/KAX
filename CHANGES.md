		- Thanks to Citizen247 for the patches. 
	+ `bulkheadProfiles` added to every part.
		- KSP 1.6.0 is happy now.
	+ Changes on the sample crafts.
		- Fixed `KAX Horizon` to be loadable without SM_Stryker 
		- Fixed KAX Choppah (added the engine back)
		- Added some new crafts - KAX and FS only.
		- All crafts are KSP 1.4.1 and up compatible.
	+ Changes on the File Hierarchy
		- Moved sample crafts to a proper place
		- Some vessel's filenames renamed to a more readable format.
		- Dependencies **ARE NOT** embedded anymore.
		- Cleaning up ZIPs from the main distribution files.
		- Resources file moved out from GameData and added to an Extras directory to be manually added by the user. Firespitter is now a hard dependency for the parts, so there's no need for it anymore.
