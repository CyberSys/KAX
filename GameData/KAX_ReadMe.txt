KAX v2.6.1 for KSP 1.0.5

Extract the KAX folder, Firespitter folder, and ModuleManager.dll into your Gamedata folder.  
Be sure to properly extract the Firespitter/Resources folder or you will have FScoolant errors.  
If you already have Firespitter and/or Module Manager, use the latest versions of their .dll plugins.
